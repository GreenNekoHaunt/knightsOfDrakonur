To set up the project make sure to set the following settings accordingly:

1. Make sure the Compile Sdk Version is at least API 18: Android 4.3 (Jelly Bean).
   It was tested on that version and definitely works on it.
   
2. The project is being compiled the the Build Tools Version 20.0.0.
   So you might want to use that version to make sure it's working.
   
3. The project requires the Android API so make sure it is linked correctly.

4. In the run configurations (Run->Edit Configurations on Android Studio) make sure to set the launch
   activity to src.KnightsOfDrakonur.
